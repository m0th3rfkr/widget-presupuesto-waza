echo "🔍 What ComprehensiveStack will create:"
echo "--------------------------------------"
echo "✅ S3 Bucket for data storage"
echo "✅ DynamoDB table for structured data"
echo "✅ Lambda function with Bedrock integration"
echo "✅ API Gateway with REST endpoints"
echo "✅ IAM roles with secure permissions"
echo "✅ CloudWatch logs for monitoring"
echo "✅ EventBridge for scheduled processing"

echo "💡 To deploy (once you have PowerUserAccess):"
echo "---------------------------------------------"
echo "cdk bootstrap                    # One-time setup"
echo "cdk deploy BedrockStack         # Deploy AI stack"
echo "cdk deploy ComprehensiveStack   # Deploy full application"
echo "cdk deploy --all                # Deploy everything"

echo "🧪 After deployment, you can:"
echo "-----------------------------"
echo "• Call REST APIs for AI processing"
echo "• Invoke Lambda functions directly"
echo "• Store and retrieve data from S3/DynamoDB"
echo "• Monitor everything in CloudWatch"
echo "• Scale automatically based on demand"

echo ""
echo "🎯 This demonstrates 'deploy anything you build':"
echo "------------------------------------------------"
echo "• Complete AI-powered applications"
echo "• Serverless architectures"
echo "• Data processing pipelines"
echo "• REST APIs with authentication"
echo "• Monitoring and logging"
echo "• Event-driven processing"
echo "• And much more!"
